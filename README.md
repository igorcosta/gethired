Inspired by the work of:

Google Interview University by @jwasham
Everything you need to kick ass on your coding interview by @andreis

I decided to create my own, it's basically a set of practical tests written in python and javascript.

Mostly because python and Javascript have a common ground for me.

There are two directories one for python and other for js with the challenge itself.

Most of the solutions are considered on the Big O(n) to solve it. Sometimes is hard to KISS.

Anyway feel free to talk, fork or do whatever you want.
