Inspired by the work of:

[Google Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university) by @jwasham
[Everything you need to kick ass on your coding interview](https://github.com/andreis/interview) by @andreis

### Reasons
I decided to create my own, it's basically a set of practical challenges written in python and javascript.

I did that while I was getting prepared myself

Mostly because python and Javascript have a common ground for me.



### Project description

There are two directories one for python and other for js with the challenge itself.


### Considerations

Most of the solutions are considered on the Big O(n) to solve it. Sometimes is hard to KISS.

Anyway feel free to talk, fork or do whatever you want.
